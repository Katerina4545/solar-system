# solar-system
test task, landing page for a course about the solar system  Tools: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, jQuery, scrollie, Figma.  About project:  I used the bootstrap library to provide responsive layout. The approach of semantically correct layout was followed. As an interactive element, you can change the background when scrolling the page. Duplicate styles for elements were merged into classes. The layout was made in figma. A grid was used for bootstrap. Disadvantages of landing page:  Sections overlap with each other when the width is less than 1000, and the problem was not solved. Testing was performed in the chrome browser, and overlays are also performed in other browsers.
